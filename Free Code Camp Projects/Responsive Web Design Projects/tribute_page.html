          Ada Lovelace, known as the First Computer Programmer, was born on 10
          December 1815 in London to the then famous poet Lord Byron and Anne
          Isabella Milbanke. After a month of her birth, Ada and her mother were
          abandoned by Byron, who left England and later died in Greece.
          Although formal education was quite unusual for women in that era, Ada
          was put to home tuitions on Mathematics and Science since a very early
          age by her mother, because she considered it to be way of keeping Ada
          away from developing the traits of her father that had led to his
          insane behavior. This helped Ada in flourishing her skills for
          numbers. The life changing event that led Ada onto becoming a great
          mathematician and programmer was when she met Charles Babbage (the
          inventor of first mechanical computer; the difference engine) in 1833
          at the age of 17. Ada was given the opportunity of seeing a small
          scale version of the difference engine, study its documents and
          understand its operation. She continued her studies in mathematics
          with the great mathematician Mary Somerville; who helped her
          understand modern mathematics and solve difficult problems. She
          discontinued with her passion for mathematics at the age of 19, when
          she got married to William King, the Earl of Lovelace in 1835 and
          became countess of Lovelace after three years. Still having keen
          interest in mathematics and Charles Babbage’s difference engine, Ada
          resumed her learning under Mary Somerville and Professor Augustus De
          Morgan in 1841. By then, Charles Babbage had started working on
          another great and advanced invention, the analytical engine. An
          Italian Engineer, Luigi Federico Menabrea had produced an article
          titled as “Sketch of Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine” for a Swiss
          journal. Ada translated it into English along with some additional
          notes on her own understanding and calculations for working of the
          engine. Some of the things that she included in her notes and that
          allowed Ada to be known as the world’s first computer programmer
          include: The Bernoulli number algorithm A method through which the
          engine can repeat a series of instructions. Codes in the engine that
          can lead it to work on not just numbers but also convert other
          disciplines like alphabets, music etc. into numerical data. Her notes
          were greatly acknowledged by Babbage and were published in an English
          science journal in 1843. Unfortunately, not much work was done on
          Ada’s ideas at that time. But her vision of engines performing beyond
          a calculator proved to be practical and got translated into reality by
          later mathematicians and scientists. One of those was Alan Turing, a
          scientist who came about 90 years after Ada Lovelace. Ada’s notes were
          amongst the writings he studied as a young scientist. Later, he came
          forth with the idea of The Universal Turing Machine, which proved to
          be the origin of modern computers. In 1953, a scientist B.V. Bowden
          presented her idea again by getting her article republished in Faster
          Than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines. In 1980, a
          new computer language was developed which was named as ‘Ada’ after
          her, by the U.S. Department of Defense. Ada Lovelace died very young,
          at the age of 32. In 1852, she was afflicted with uterine cancer which
          took her life on November 27, in London. Fulfilling her wish, she was
          buried in Nottingham, in the graveyard of the Church of St. Mary
          Magdalene beside her father’s grave.
